* Horizontal menu: put in ' navbar-nav mr-auto sm-rtl'

## Template launch reasons 
The inspiration to bring that template to life was other Boostrap4 based theme I had found when have been trying to find some SIMPLE template to use on mywebsite. You can find it here:

https://github.com/sniggle/joomla-bootstrap4-template

Simple becuase.. I needed something basic, elementary. Like Joomla! core Protostar, but with some newest technologies. Not some 'Powered by X Framework' like templates. Yes, there are great, but to set up a basic website there are just ... too confusing and time consuming.

You could now ask "Why didn't just contribute to that Boostrap4 template project"
The answer is that I just wated to create something on one's own and learn something new on my way to .. learn coding and .. maybe find a new job... 

Anyway it's just my hobby right now.
